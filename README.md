# Name-Based Port Mapper (Nbpm)

Nbpm is a lightweight Elixir module that provides a simplified implementation of the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) protocol. It enables basic functionality for mapping Erlang node names to network ports. This module is designed as a convenient alternative to a full EPMD implementation, making it easier to facilitate communication between Erlang nodes.

## Features

- `Mix.Release` compatibility.
- Ability to specify port number in the node name.
- Hash-Based Port from node name.

## Installation

To use Nbpm in your Elixir project, add it as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
def deps do
[
    {:nbpm, "~> 0.2.0"}
]
end
```
